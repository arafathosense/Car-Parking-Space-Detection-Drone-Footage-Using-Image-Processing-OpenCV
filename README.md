**Car Parking-Space Detection Drone Footage Using Image Processing OpenCV**

A drone-based car parking space detection system using classical Image Processing and OpenCV. This project analyzes aerial footage to automatically detect empty and occupied parking spots in real time. It uses background subtraction, contour analysis, masking, and ROI mapping techniques to achieve accurate slot detection from drone footage. Ideal for smart-parking, surveillance, and automated monitoring applications.
